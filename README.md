## Vishal Kaklotar — Senior Flutter Developer

I am a Flutter developer with 4+ years of experience building scalable, maintainable,
and testable mobile applications.

My primary focus is **engineering quality**, not just UI delivery.

---

### What I Specialize In

- Clean Architecture (feature-first, domain-driven)
- SOLID principles applied practically in Flutter
- Bloc for predictable and testable state management
- Offline-first data strategies (local cache + sync)
- Strong separation of concerns
- Unit & Bloc testing for business logic
- Production-ready project structuring

---

### What You Will Find in This GitHub

This profile is intentionally minimal.

Instead of many small demo apps, I maintain **a few well-engineered repositories**
that demonstrate how I build Flutter applications in real-world, production scenarios.

You will see:
- Strict architectural boundaries
- Clearly defined data flow
- Business logic isolated from UI
- Testable design with meaningful tests
- Code written for long-term maintenance and scalability

---

### My Engineering Philosophy

- Architecture matters more than UI polish
- Business logic should be framework-independent
- State management should be explicit and predictable
- Code should be easy to extend without rewriting existing features
- Tests are written to protect behavior, not increase coverage numbers

---

### Ideal Projects

I work best on:
- Long-term Flutter projects
- Apps that require scalability and clean architecture
- Codebase refactoring and stabilization
- Performance and reliability improvements
- Teams that value engineering discipline
